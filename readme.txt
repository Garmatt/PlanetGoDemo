This is a small snippet from a project I've recently started: I'm developing a Go* server. Namely, a web application for browser-based correspondence Go. What this means is that, unlike most other Go servers, this one does not require installing any client software: players will simply submit a move through their browser, and will be notified when their turn comes again.
The project is an ASP.NET MVC + SQLServer + AngularJS solution, with an ASP.NET Identity membership system. I'm also using this project as a means to familiarize myself with Entity Framework and Bootstrap, which I've never had a chance to use at work.
At the moment, the server side of the project is not developed enough to be of any interest. Therefore, I've decided to just pack up the client-side logic in a (much) stripped-down version of the application's game view. This web page is stand-alone (it does not communicate with a web server and does not ever require an internet connection), and contains an AngularJS module that implements the basic rules of Go. As a demo, it can be used to play rudimentary "hotseat" games.

*Go is the Japanese name of an ancient board game originated in China, also known as Weiqi (in Mandarin) and Baduk (in Korean).
